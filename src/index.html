  <div class="right accomplishments">
    <div class="bottom-line">
      <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-left:-10px"><a href="https://www.videoder.com" target="_blank">Videoder</a> is now
        a very popular entertainment app which has now grown upto <b>3M DAU</b> with
        around <b>100K DNU</b>. I played various roles
        in past few years, which ranged from handling tech, finding growth hacks, coming up with new features
        which provided USP to our product, revenue optimization, UI/UX, prioritizing work and continuously listening to
        feedback from our users. Following are few important tasks that I performed during this time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented Runtime Dex Loading, facilitating the app to update all the volatile logic without actually
          updating app.
        </li>
        <li>Built crowdsourced localization infrastructure fueled by our volunteers which ultimately helped to save us
          significant bucks and helped the app to be translated in 44 languages.
        </li>
        <li>Worked on driving growth on social media which resulted ultimately in DNU growth. (Our FB page has 1.2
          million
          likes now and DNU of 100k)
        </li>
        <li>Created a powerful browser with features like adblocker, history, incognito browsing etc to increase in app
          session time.
        </li>
        <li>Wrote extractors for various media sites to create USP for our product.</li>
        <li>Created first HLS downloader in android space which could download encrypted HLS streams and stitch them
          back
          together. This helped us to support media sites which streamed HLS content.
        </li>
        <li>Developed multi-threaded downloader to boost up the downloading speed.</li>
        <li>Implemented SSL pinning to ensure security and avoid MITM attacks</li>
        <li>Wrote copied link detection feature to recognize any playable/downloadable link which is copied to
          clipboard.
        </li>
        <li>Implemented beta distribution channel so that early adopters can give feedbacks and report bugs, ultimately
          improving stability and adaption of our final releases.
        </li>
        <li>Came up with and implemented other features like Meta Tag Editor, Subtitles etc. to drive growth and
          engagement.
        </li>
        <li>Wrote algorithm to serve ads and incorporate third party Ad networks to increase revenue.</li>
        <li>Automated release process (build, upload and verify) for several modules which saved 70+ man hours till date
        <li>Implemented latest libraries and concepts like (ExoMedia, Gson, Fresco, RXJava, Kotlin etc.) to keep up with
          industry standards and android community.
        </li>
        <li>Designed code architecture, implemented design patterns like MVP and wrote test cases to increase
          productivity
          and sustainability of code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="bottom-line">
      <ul>
        <li>Developed, designed and did the SEO of my website driving daily traffic from 20k to 70k.</li>
        <li>Created internal dashboards and tools like revenue dashboard, status dashboard etc.</li>
        <li>Developed notification delivery system on the top of FCM api which is then used in our app to show
          notifications, banners and to send deeplinks.
        </li>
        <li>Built Rest API using nodejs and express for sending updated configurations, storing user data, analytics,
          extractions etc.
        </li>
        <li>Configured NGINX to act as load balancer which could scale out horizontally when load increases. Presently
          it
          servers over 1500 requests/second.
        </li>
        <li>Configured MySQL server, created schema and performed database admin duties.</li>
        <li>Configured MongoDB with a delayed replication to store data where RDBMS was not sufficing, like user
          recommendations, watch history etc.
        </li>
        <li>Configured Redis to store web sessions, cache important and volatile configurations, push events etc.</li>
        <li>Wrote few crons which helped with stuff like generating Ad revenue reports, tracking installs and
          uninstalls,
          processing scheduled pushes etc.
        </li>
        <li>Configured custom mail server using vesta control panel to run mail campaigns.</li>
      </ul>
